      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend developer who builds accessible, fast, and responsive web interfaces.
        I love working with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vite</strong>, and I’m currently exploring
        <strong> Firebase</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> for backend integration. My goal is to create apps
        that feel good to use — not just look pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always up for learning new tools, joining collaborative projects, or building cool things
        that solve real problems.
      </p>
    </section>
